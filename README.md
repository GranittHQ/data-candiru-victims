# Candiru Victim Database

This database tracks details about victims of Candiru's spyware. Each entry represents either an individual or a small group of people, such as a team of lawyers. For that reason, you wonâ€™t find a single entry for the "more than 100 victims" [reported](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/) by Microsoft in 2021. The goal is to make each entry as comprehensive as possible by collecting and sorting published reports. The database is updated regularly as more information becomes available.
